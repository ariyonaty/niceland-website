      <div className="subtitle font-big-section-description">
        Niceland is a startup-company registered and operated out of Iceland.
        The focus of the platform is to create a VPN that prioritizes anonymity while still maintaining a high degree of quality.
        In order to accomplish this goal Niceland had to be built from the ground up without using pre-built VPN solutions while avoiding the use of any platforms and tools that utilize analytics or user tracking.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In its core, Niceland is a global Mesh network that offers VPN functionality but does not operate like a normal VPN.
